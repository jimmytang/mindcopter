Hi Jimmy,

as a fellow developer I thought you might appreciate my unsual outreach via a pull request to you. I am currently working on a project in an adjacent field to your last startup Trueplan.io. I would love to connect with you and chat, since there are probably tons of learnings that you gained over the last 2 years. My project is around people analytics, HR insights & data related to HRIS & ATS systems, but I would love to learn more about what you worked on and what motivated you to sell Trueplan and join Rippling.

Would you have time for a 30 min coffee chat with me? Feel free to send me an email to mathias.j.klenk@gmail.com and I would love to find time for us to chat in the coming weeks!

Best,
Mathias
